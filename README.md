# Glaucoma-Detection
This repository contains MATLAB codes for Glaucoma Detection using HRF images obtained from Kingston University. The code uses various image processing techniques, however, requires a human to point out three points so as to calculate the angle to check for glaucoma.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
The version of MATLAB used by us did not support the inbuilt function 'activeseg' that is present in the newer versions. 'activeseg' basically performs segmentation on the main image to give us the Region of Interest (RoI).

# Glaucoma-Detection
This repository contains MATLAB codes for Glaucoma Detection using HRF images obtained from Kingston University. The code uses various image processing techniques, however, requires a human to point out three points so as to calculate the angle to check for glaucoma.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
